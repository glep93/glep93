# About me

I am a Data Scientis with  background on theoretical physics focus on the design of models at the state of art. I like to develop my models with Python, and I always try to design my software to reduce manual effort. During my professional experience I have worked on all the data path: extraction (web scrapers), cleansing and transformation (ETL), data visualization and models develop.
